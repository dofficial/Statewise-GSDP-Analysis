# Statewise-GSDP-Analysis

![Dashboard Preview](1.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **Tableau dashboard** analyzing the  
**Per Capita Net State Domestic Product (NSDP)** across Indian states for the periods:
- **1990–1995**
- **2005–2010**

The aim of this project is to provide **economic insights for policy and governance** by examining disparities and growth trends in per capita NSDP across Indian states and union territories.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Total Value (All India)** → Aggregated NSDP across all states  
- **Average Value per State** → Benchmark to compare state performance  
- **Highest & Lowest Value States** → Identifies top and bottom performers  
- **Top States Comparison** → Bar chart comparing high-value states  
- **Trend Over Time** → Multi-year trend analysis (1990–95, 2005–10)  
- **States vs Years (Heatmap)** → Quick glance at growth patterns  
- **State-wise Distribution (Map)** → Geographic distribution of per capita NSDP  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Top States**: Goa, Delhi, and Chandigarh consistently rank high in per capita NSDP.  
- **Lower Value States**: Bihar, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh remain at the bottom.  
- **Trends Over Time**: A sharp increase in per capita NSDP is observed post-2005.  
- **State-wise Distribution**: Highlights regional disparities, showing stronger economies in coastal and metropolitan states.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
### 🔹 Data Collection & Cleaning
- **Excel** → Extracted state-wise NSDP data from multiple yearly sheets (1990–95, 2005–10).  
- Removed headers, standardized state names, merged datasets into a master table (`master_table.xlsx`).  

### 🔹 Data Analysis & Visualization
- **Tableau Desktop**  
  - Built interactive dashboard (`Statewise-GSDP-Analysis.twbx`).  
  - Created KPI cards, bar charts, heatmaps, line charts, and geographical maps.  
  - Combined multiple datasets into a single visualization framework.  

### 🔹 Version Control & Sharing
- **GitHub** → Repository for datasets, Tableau workbook, and dashboard screenshots.  
- Ensures reproducibility and transparency.
